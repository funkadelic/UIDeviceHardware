================

Based off of https://gist.github.com/Ricardo1980/2973281, which is a fork of https://gist.github.com/Jaybles/1323251, with some cleanup and newer device additions. 

This will be updated as new iDevices come out.


###Usage

    NSLog(@"platformString %@", [UIDeviceHardware platformString]);
